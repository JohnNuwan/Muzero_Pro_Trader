## 🎯 Core Assumptions

| Parameter | Conservative Value | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Monthly Return** | 12% | V3.1 backtest × safety factor 5 |
| **Win Rate** | 52-58% | MuZero V3.1 Hunger Mode target |
| **Max Drawdown** | <10% | Risk management limits |

## 📅 Phase 1: Validation & Bootstrap (Months 1-3)

### Goal
Validate V3.1 on 1 FTMO $10k account and generate capital for immediate scaling.

### Month 1: First Paycheck
- **Capital**: $10,000 (FTMO Demo → Challenge → Funded)
- **Performance**: +12% = $1,200
- **Profit Share**: 90% = $1,080
- **Net (after 30% tax)**: **€715**

💡 *Already more than the entire ROI of Phase 1 in the old plan (V2 was €253).*

### Month 2: Powder for Scaling
- **Capital**: $10,000
- **Performance**: +12% = $1,200
- **Net**: **€715**
- **Action**: Buy 2× FTMO $50k challenges (€350 each = €700)

### Month 3: The Armada Prepares
- **Account 1** ($10k): **€715** payout
- **Accounts 2 & 3** ($50k): In validation (V3.1 crushes challenge in 2 weeks)

**Phase 1 Total Net**: **€2,145**

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: The Explosion (Months 4-6)

- **Net**: **€29,000**
- **Action**: Buy 2× $200k challenges (€1,000 each)

### Month 6: Escape Velocity
- **Portfolio**: 1× $10k + 2× $50k + 3× $100k + 2× $200k = **$810,000**
- **Performance** (12%): $97,200
- **Profit Share** (90%): $87,480
- **Net**: **€57,400**

**Phase 2 Total Net**: **€94,200**

## 💎 Phase 3: Financial Independence (Months 7-12)

### Month 7-12: The Golden Goose
- **Stable Portfolio**: $800k - $1M (10-15 FTMO accounts)
- **Monthly Performance** (12%): ~$100k
- **Profit Share** (90%): ~$90k
- **Net/Month**: **€59,000**

**Annual Net Income**: **€590,000** (from month 7 onward)

### Key Milestones

## 🏆 Year 1 Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Starting Capital** | €10,000 |
| **Prop Firm Capital (Month 12)** | $1.8M |

## 🌍 5-Year Vision: From Prop Firms to Private Capital

### Year 2-3: Scaling to the Limit
- **Max Prop Firm Portfolio**: $5M (regulatory limits)
- **Monthly Income**: €300k
- **Personal Savings**: €2M accumulated

### Year 3-5: Transition to Private Capital
- **Strategy**: Use €2M personal capital with same 12% monthly
- **Why**: 
  - No profit sharing (100% yours vs 90%)
  - No withdrawal limits
  - Full control
- **Monthly Income (Year 5)**: 
  - Personal Capital: €2M × 12% = €240k/month
  - Prop Firms: €300k/month (kept for diversification)
  - **Total**: €540k/month = **€6.5M/year**

### Net Worth Projection (Year 5)
- **Personal Trading Capital**: €2M
- **Real Estate**: €3M (bought with profits)
- **Savings/Investments**: €1M
- **Total**: **€6M+**

---

## 🛡️ Risk Management Rules

### Capital Preservation
1. **Max 3% risk per trade** (MuZero decides position size within this limit)
2. **Max 10% drawdown per account** (auto-pause trading if breached)
3. **Diversification**: Never more than 30% of total capital on one symbol

### Psychological Safety
- **Never trade live if training reward <+40** (model not ready)
- **Weekly performance review** (TensorBoard + MT5 report)
- **Monthly external audit** (compare to manual backtest)

### Prop Firm Strategy
- **Start small**: Prove on $10k before scaling
- **Diversify providers**: FTMO, FundedNext, E8 (avoid single point of failure)
- **Follow rules strictly**: One violation = loss of account

## 📊 Sensitivity Analysis

### What if Monthly Return is Lower?

| Monthly Return | Month 7 Income | Financial Independence |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **15%** | €80k | Month 6 |
| **12%** (base) | €59k | Month 7 |
| **10%** | €45k | Month 8 |
| **8%** | €33k | Month 10 |
| **5%** | €18k | Month 15 |

💡 *Even at 5% (half the target), financial independence in 15 months.*

### What if V3.1 Fails to Deliver?
- **Fallback**: V3.0 (already proven at 40 reward = ~8% monthly)
- **Result**: Financial independence in ~24 months instead of 7 (still acceptable)

---

## 🎓 Key Lessons from the Plan

### 1. Compound Interest is Magic
€10k → €185k in 12 months is **1,750% ROI**, but it's not from one big win. It's:
- Month 1: €715 (7% monthly on €10k)
- Month 12: €59k (9% monthly on €650k prop capital)

**The capital grows exponentially, not the skill.**

### 2. Prop Firms are Leverage Tools
- **Input**: €350 (challenge fee)
- **Output**: $50k capital (142× leverage)
- **If you fail**: -€350 (limited downside)
- **If you succeed**: Infinite upside

### 3. Speed Matters
- **Old Plan (V2, 3% monthly)**: 10 months to €10k/month
- **New Plan (V3.1, 12% monthly)**: 4 months to €10k/month
- **Difference**: 6 months = €200k+ in lost opportunity cost

### 4. Automation is Essential
Manual trading at this scale is impossible:
- 11 symbols × 24/7 = 264 hours/week of potential trading
- MuZero never sleeps, never gets emotional, never deviates from the plan

## ⚠️ Disclaimers & Realities

### This is NOT a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme
- **Hard work**: Months of coding, training, debugging
- **Risk**: Forex/CFD trading can lose 100% of capital
- **Taxes**: 30% of profits (or more, depending on country)
- **Prop Firm Rules**: Strict (one violation = account loss)

### Assumptions May Not Hold
- **Market Regime Change**: What works in 2024 may not work in 2025
- **Prop Firm Changes**: Withdrawal limits, rule changes
- **Regulatory Risk**: CFD trading restrictions (e.g., ESMA in EU)

### Psychological Challenges
- **Drawdowns**: Even at 52% win rate, you'll have losing weeks
- **Discipline**: No manual overrides (trust the bot or don't use it)
- **Patience**: Month 1-3 are slow (€700/month). Don't quit.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Validate V3.1** (1 month on $10k FTMO demo)
2. **Pass Challenge** (2 weeks on FTMO $10k)
3. **First Payout** (1 month on funded account)
4. **Scale Aggressively** (buy 2-3 challenges/month with profits)
5. **Reach Independence** (Month 7-8, $800k portfolio)

---

**Remember**: This plan is a roadmap, not a guarantee. Market conditions, model performance, and prop firm policies can change. Adapt, monitor, and stay disciplined.

**The bot is the weapon. Your discipline is the ammunition.**
